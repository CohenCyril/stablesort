  Stable sort algorithms and their stability proofs in Coq

description: |-
  This library provides a generic way to prove the stability of sorting
  algorithms. The stability lemmas provided in this library are overloaded using
  a canonical structure (`StableSort.interface`), and stable sort functions are
  characterized in this interface by the parametricity axiom and binary trees
  representing the divide-and-conquer structure of sort. One may prove the
  stability of a new sorting function by using the parametricity translation
  (Paramcoq) and providing a lemma corresponding to the binary tree
  construction. This library also provides optimized sorting algorithms: one for
  the call-by-need evaluation (`CBN.sort`) and another for the call-by-value
  evaluation (`CBV.sort`).
