synopsis: "Stable sort algorithms and their stability proofs in Coq"
description: """
This library provides a generic way to prove the stability of sorting
algorithms. The stability lemmas provided in this library are overloaded using
a canonical structure (`StableSort.interface`), and stable sort functions are
characterized in this interface by the parametricity axiom and binary trees
representing the divide-and-conquer structure of sort. One may prove the
stability of a new sorting function by using the parametricity translation
(Paramcoq) and providing a lemma corresponding to the binary tree
construction. This library also provides optimized mergesort algorithms: ones
for the call-by-need evaluation and others for the call-by-value evaluation.

The mergesort functions and the stability proofs provided in this library are
mostly based on ones in the `path` library of Mathematical Components."""
